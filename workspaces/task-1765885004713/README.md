# Sample Website

This project contains a simple sample website designed for demonstration and quick preview purposes.

## File Structure

```
/
├── index.html       # Main HTML file to open in a browser
├── styles.css       # Optional CSS file for styling (if present)
└── README.md        # This documentation file
```

## Previewing the Website

To preview the sample website, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. No additional setup or dependencies are required.

- Locate the `index.html` file in the project root.
- Double-click the file or right-click and choose "Open With" followed by your browser.
- The website will render directly from the local file system.

This setup is ideal for quick testing of static HTML and CSS content without a server environment.
